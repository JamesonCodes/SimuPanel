  {
    question: "How accurate are the results?",
    answer: "The underlying SSR methodology achieves approximately 90% of human test‚Äìretest reliability on validated consumer datasets, benchmarked across 9,000 survey participants. This gives you the realism of human focus-group data, without the cost or waiting."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upload images or mockups?",
    answer: "Yes. Upload product visuals or packaging mockups ‚Äî SimuPanel automatically captions and integrates them into the simulation context."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a test take?",
    answer: "Most simulations complete in under 60 seconds. Larger multi-test batches may take a few minutes, but every result is generated in real time."
  },
  {
    question: "What data do you store?",
    answer: "Only anonymized concept text and aggregated response distributions for benchmarking. We don't store personal information, uploaded files, or customer content beyond your active session."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it for any industry?",
    answer: "Yes. The model adapts to consumer language across categories ‚Äî from CPG to SaaS to apparel. Results are context-aware and calibrated to your chosen persona."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any technical setup?",
    answer: "No. Just paste your concept or upload a mockup, select a persona, and click Run Test. Everything happens automatically in the background."
  }
